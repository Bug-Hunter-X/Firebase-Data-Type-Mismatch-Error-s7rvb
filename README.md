# Firebase Data Type Mismatch

This repository demonstrates a common error in Firebase: data type mismatches when retrieving data from the database.  The `bug.js` file showcases code that attempts to access data without proper type checking, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution demonstrating robust type checking and handling of potential data type mismatches.

## Problem
The Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore can return data in unexpected formats. If your app expects a specific type (e.g., a number) but receives a different type (e.g., a string), your app might crash or malfunction. This can be particularly tricky to debug if the data source changes unexpectedly.

## Solution
Always validate the type of data received from Firebase before processing it. Add explicit type checking to prevent runtime errors. Handle cases where the data is not in the expected format gracefully to avoid app crashes.
